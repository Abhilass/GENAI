                               Comprehensive Company Analysis Report
                                            Mid-2025 Update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

HLV LIMITED (NSE: HLVLTD, BSE: 500193), operating in India’s luxury hospitality space since 1981, is a significant player managing iconic properties such as The Leela Mumbai. With a current market capitalization between INR 500-750 crores (USD ~65-100 million), it has a strong promoter presence (36-39%) complemented by substantial public shareholding (~59%). The company operates in a challenging yet opportunity-rich environment characterized by a gradual post-pandemic recovery, escalating costs, and competitive pressures.

Recent financials indicate mixed results. The trailing twelve months revenue stands at approximately INR 190 crores (~USD 23.6 million), with the latest quarter (Q1 FY 2026) reporting a loss of INR 3.47 crore, reflecting earnings volatility after three profitable quarters. Stock performance highlights a downtrend in 2024, over 25% decline from 2023 highs, evidencing investor caution and sector headwinds.

Looking ahead, HLV LIMITED’s prospects hinge on India’s domestic tourism growth, strategic asset rationalization, technological adoption, and brand leverage. However, macroeconomic uncertainties and competitive dynamics pose risks. Based on the current valuation, financial health, and sector outlook, a cautious Buy rating is recommended for long-term investors seeking exposure to luxury hospitality recovery, with due attention to volatility.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION

HLV LIMITED stands as a reputable legacy player in India’s luxury hospitality sector, operating premier properties with significant brand recognition. Despite recent profitability setbacks and stock price erosion, the company's prospects are underpinned by growth opportunities in domestic travel, structural balance sheet improvements, and strategic repositioning plans.

The hospitality industry’s inherent cyclicality and macro risks necessitate a measured outlook. Investors should view HLV LIMITED as a long-term thematic play on Indian luxury tourism revival, with the caveat of near-term earnings unpredictability.

Accordingly, we assign a cautious Buy rating with the recommendation for investors to watch operational metrics and broader economic indicators closely before increasing exposure.
